Note:
There is a [reoccuring issue](https://github.com/iurisegtovich/PyTherm-applied-thermodynamics/issues/11) with github rendering Jupyter notebooks. If you get an error message saying `Sorry, something went wrong` when you try to view the notebook, use [this link](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/TonyBlonigan/android_malware_detection/blob/master/Android%20Malware%20Detection.ipynb) instead.
